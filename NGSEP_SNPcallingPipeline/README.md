## Scripts used for NGSEP SNP calling from command line

The NGSEP pipeline was developed at CIAT. More informations on the pipeline and tutorials could be found in the [published paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413664) or in the [download page] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngsep/)

I included a step by step tutorial in the `GBSTutorial` paper where I used NGSEP just for SNPs calling, while I preprocess the reads with a [custom pipeline] (https://github.com/aariani/GBSprep), align them with BWA, and post-process the alignment files with samtools
