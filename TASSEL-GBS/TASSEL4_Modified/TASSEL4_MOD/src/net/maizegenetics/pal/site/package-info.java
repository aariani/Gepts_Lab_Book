/**
 * Site package supports lists of sites and their annotation.
 * <p>
 *     Definitions:
 *     <p></p>
 *     Sites are any defined point in the genome.  Generally they are polymorphic, but they do not need to
 *     be.
 *     <p></p>
 *     Locus - is generally a chromosome, and multiple sites are generally part of one chromosomes.  While sites are frequently
 *     nested within a locus for viewing.  There is no need for sites to be sorted that way.
 *     <p></p>
 *     Annotations are descriptors about a site, e.g. reference allele, minor allele frequency, strand, etc.
