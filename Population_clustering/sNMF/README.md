### sNMF is an algorithm for population clustering in the LEA R package

See [LEA page](http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/LEA/index.htm) for more infos

There are also scripts for creating barplots of ancestry coefficients.

I divided the scripts based on the different projects, especially the scripts for plotting with R
